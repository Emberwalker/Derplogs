## Build and Run
For development, set the `DEBUG` environment variable and then run `sbt`, the Simple Buid Tool. Install it if necessary. Once `sbt` drops you into the 'shell'-like environment, run `~ run` to run the dev server with auto-reloading enabled. This will launch the dev server on `0.0.0.0:9000`. Drop the tilde in the `run` command to run without auto-reload.
